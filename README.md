## ⚠️ GitHub API Rate Limiting

### Current Implementation
This project uses the public GitHub API without authentication, which means:
- Rate limit: 60 requests per hour per IP address
- No token required
- Suitable for testing and demonstration

### Rate Limit Error
If you see "GitHub API error: 403" or "API rate limit exceeded", you have two options:

1. **Wait for Rate Limit Reset**
   - The rate limit resets every hour
   - Try again after an hour

2. **Add Your Own GitHub Token**
   ```javascript
   // In script.js, update the fetch functions:
   async function fetchUserData(username) {
       try {
           const headers = {
               'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN',
               'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
           };
           const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`, { headers });
           // ... rest of the function
       }
   }
   ```

### Getting a GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `read:user` and `public_repo`
4. Copy and use your token
5. ⚠️ Keep your token private and never commit it to public repositories
